# hello-world
practicing how to create a repository

Hello,

my name is Matt. I studied IS in university and graduated in 2003. But I 
never went into technology. Instead, I got a job in logistics where I soon
became bored and moved to South Korea to teach English. I've been here for
the better part of a decade but plan on moving back to the US soon. So, I
decided to start practicing my programming and web development skills to 
see if it was something I stil enjoyed. Low and behold, here I am preparing
to make my first 'commit'.
